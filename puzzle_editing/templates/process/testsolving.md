## How to run a testsolving session

1. Go to your puzzle's page. (Find it on the **Yours** page, linked in the top menu.) Next to the header **Testsolve Sessions**, click the button "Start a New Testsolve Session."

2. This will create a new testsolve session. Edit the Session Notes with the date and time of your session. If you don't know this yet, leave it blank.

3. Copy the URL of this page.

4. In the Discord channel #testsolving-announcements, post a the link, along the date and time. (Or poll for times.) Folks will sign up. We recommend having at least two solvers in your test and preferably more -- we can't duplicate Mystery Hunt conditions, but we can try our best.

5.  If your puzzle can't be tested in Google Drive, contact the Testsolve Coordinators and they'll help you figure something out.

6. Add the testsolve to our team calendar. You can also do this via Niles bot in Discord. Go to the #calendar channel to learn how.

7. Meet your solvers in the spreadsheet at the appointed time and send them off to solve!
