## So you want to write a puzzle… (yay!)

_Items that you do are in blue and editor actions are in red_

1. Get ideas
  1. Post in, or read (and volunteer as a co-author in) #puzzle-ideas
  2. Talk to an editor, co-author, or other teammates
  3. Start a notepad / doc / list of puzzle ideas and add to it when you think of or see something puzzly
2. Put your idea into puzzup
  1. Can be at various levels of refinement
    1. Just an idea
    2. Proof of concept (single clue, detailed description)
    3. Has a rough draft/multiple proof-of-concept items
  2. Can state what kind of answer(s) you’d like (letter constraints, thematic, etc.)
3. Get matched with an editor (est. wait time: 24h)
4. Set up a time to talk it through with each other in the next few days
5. Editor can voice any concerns and outline what next steps they’d like to see before moving it forward
  1. Repeat as needed; auto-meet if it has been >2 weeks without consensus since step 3)
6. Editor requests a draft and provides an answer when the idea is ready
7. You provide a draft! (turnaround time: 10 days from step 6)
  1. You ask questions ASAP if you get stuck on the process or need support
  2. Editor should follow up if it is past the turnaround time, or 1 week since an update was given)
8. Repeat steps 4 thru 7 until editor approves it for testsolves
9. Repeat steps 4 thru 7 until you have 2 clean testsolves
  1. Coordinate with testsolve coordinator to find a time that works
  2. Revise your puzzles based on what you see happen within 3 days of the testsolve ending (discussing with editor as needed)


*Repeat from step 0! These final few steps take place after your puzzle is essentially finalized.*
1. Learn how to postprod and do it!
2. Write canned hints (this can be delayed til a few months prior to hunt)
3. Write a solution
